   Just some ideas... things to implement or to think about...

   .. rubric:: extensible lexers
      :name: extensible-lexers

   Extensible `lexers <lexers.html>`__ would be an interesting
   extension. And possibly lexers using regular expressions (extensible
   if possible, otherwise as a different module).

   .. rubric:: utf-8
      :name: utf-8

   The Camlp5 lexer for OCaml programs (module Plexer) allows utf-8
   characters. Since utf-8 seems to have some success among unicode
   formats, perhaps a reflection to add greek characters and/or real
   utf-8 arrows in the syntax (in particular in types) would be
   interesting.
