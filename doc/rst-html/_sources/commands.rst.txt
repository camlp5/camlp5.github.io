   The main command of Camlp5 is "``camlp5``". It is an OCaml program in
   bytecode (compiled with ocamlc, not ocamlopt), able to dynamically
   load OCaml object files (ending with ".cmo" and ".cma").

   Most other Camlp5 commands derive from that one: they are the command
   "``camlp5``" with some implicitely applied parameters.

   Two other commands are provided: "``mkcamlp5``" and
   "``mkcamlp5.opt``". They allow to create camlp5 executables with
   already loaded kits.

   All commands have an option "``-help``" which display all possible
   command parameters and options. Notice that some parameters (the
   parsing and pretting kits) may add new options. For example, the
   command:

   ::

        camlp5 pr_r.cmo -help

   prints more lines than just:

   ::

        camlp5 -help

   The first parameter ("load options") allows to specify parsing and
   printing kits (".cmo" and ".cma" files) which are loaded inside the
   "``camlp5``" core before any action. Other options may follow.

   .. rubric:: Commands
      :name: commands

   ``camlp5r``
      Shortcut for "``camlp5 pa_r.cmo pa_rp.cmo pr_dump.cmo``"
   ``camlp5r.opt``
      Same as previous, but in native code instead of bytecode,
      therefore faster. But not extensible: it is not possible to add
      other parsing or printing kits neither in command arguments nor
      with the "load" directive inside sources. Suitable for compiling
      sources not using other syntax extensions.
   ``camlp5o``
      Shortcut for "``camlp5 pa_o.cmo pa_op.cmo pr_dump.cmo``"
   ``camlp5o.opt``
      Same as previous, and like "``camlp5r.opt``", faster and not
      extensible. Moreover, this has been produced by compilation of
      Camlp5 grammars, resulting in a still faster executable.
   ``camlp5sch``
      Shortcut for "``camlp5 pa_scheme.cmo pr_dump.cmo``"
   ``mkcamlp5``
      creates camlp5 executables with almost the same options than
      ocamlmktop. The interfaces to be visible must be explicitly added
      in the command line as ".cmi" files. For example, how to add the
      the OCaml module "str":
      "``mkcamlp5 -custom str.cmi str.cma     -cclib -lstr -o camlp5str``"
   ``mkcamlp5.opt``
      creates camlp5 executables like ``mkcamlp5``, except that it is in
      native code, therefore faster, but not extensible; the added kits
      must be cmx or cmxa files

   .. rubric:: Environment variable
      :name: environment-variable

   When running a program using extensible grammars (in particular, the
   camlp5 commands), the environment variable "``CAMLP5PARAM``" is
   consulted. It sets the grammar parsing algoritm parameters.

   This variable must be a sequence of parameter specifications. A
   parameter specification is a letter optionally followed by an = and a
   value, with any separator. There are four possible parameters:

   ``b``
      Set the full backtrack algorithm as default.
   ``f``
      Set the limited backtrack algorithm as default.
   ``t``
      Trace symbols (terminals and non-terminals) while parsing with
      backtracking.
   ``y``
      In backtracking, trace the advance in the input stream (number of
      unfrozen tokens) and the possible stalling (number of tokens
      tests).
   ``l=value``
      Set the maximum stalling value.

   .. rubric:: OCaml toplevel files
      :name: ocaml-toplevel-files

   These object files can be loaded in the OCaml toplevel to make Camlp5
   parse the input. It is possible to load them either by putting them
   as parameters of the toplevel, or by using the directive "load". The
   option "``-I +camlp5``" (or ":literal:`-I   `camlp5 -where\``") must
   be added to the "``ocaml``" command (the OCaml toplevel).

   ``camlp5r.cma``
      Read phrases and display results in revised syntax
   ``camlp5o.cma``
      Read phrases and display results in normal syntax
   ``camlp5sch.cma``
      Read phrases in Scheme syntax

   .. rubric:: Library files
      :name: library-files

   The `Camlp5 library <library.html>`__ is named "``gramlib.cma``" and
   its native code version is "``gramlib.cmxa``". They contain the
   modules:

   -  Ploc : building and combining `locations <locations.html>`__
   -  Plexing : lexing for Camlp5 grammars
   -  Plexer : lexer used in revised and normal syntax
   -  Gramext : implementation of extensible grammars
   -  Grammar : `extensible grammars <grammars.html>`__
   -  Extfold : functions for grammar extensions FOLD0 and FOLD1
   -  Extfun : functions for `extensible functions <extfun.html>`__
   -  Eprinter : `extensible printers <printers.html>`__
   -  Fstream : `functional streams <fparsers.html>`__
   -  Pretty : `pretty printing <pretty.html>`__ on strings

   This is a pure library : when linking with it, the Camlp5 program is
   *not* included.
